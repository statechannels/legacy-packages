## IFrameChannelProviderInterface interface

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

For environments where the wallet is proxied within an iFrame embedded on the application's DOM.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface IFrameChannelProviderInterface extends Web3ChannelProviderInterface 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [Web3ChannelProviderInterface](./iframe-channel-provider.web3channelproviderinterface.md)

## Remarks

This is as opposed to being injected via an extension background script, in which case the "mounting" is effectively done via the background script and not by the application.

|  --- | --- |
|  [mountWalletComponent(url)](./iframe-channel-provider.iframechannelproviderinterface.mountwalletcomponent.md) | <b><i>(BETA)</i></b> Trigger the mounting of the <iframe/> element which loads the wallet. |
