## Functions

- [isContract](#iscontract)
- [sendValue](#sendvalue)

---

### isContract

Returns true if `account` is a contract.
 [IMPORTANT]
 ====
 It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns
 false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.
 Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following
 types of addresses:
  - an externally-owned account
  - a contract in construction
  - an address where a contract will be created
  - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed
 ====

```solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view
returns(bool)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| account | address |  | 

### sendValue

Replacement for Solidity's `transfer`: sends `amount` wei to
 `recipient`, forwarding all available gas and reverting on errors.
 https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884[EIP1884] increases the gas cost
 of certain opcodes, possibly making contracts go over the 2300 gas limit
 imposed by `transfer`, making them unable to receive funds via
 `transfer`. {sendValue} removes this limitation.

 IMPORTANT: because control is transferred to `recipient`, care must be
 taken to not create reentrancy vulnerabilities. Consider using
 {ReentrancyGuard} or the
