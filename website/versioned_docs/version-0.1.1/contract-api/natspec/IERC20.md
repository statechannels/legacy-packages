### totalSupply

Returns the amount of tokens in existence.

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view
returns(uint256)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### balanceOf

Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view
returns(uint256)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| account | address |  | 

### transfer

Moves `amount` tokens from the caller's account to `recipient`.
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.

```solidity
function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external nonpayable
returns(bool)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| recipient | address |  | 
| amount | uint256 |  | 

### allowance

Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}. This is
zero by default.
     * This value changes when {approve} or {transferFrom} are called.

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view
returns(uint256)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| owner | address |  | 
| spender | address |  | 

### approve

Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     * IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
desired value afterwards:

     * Emits an {Approval} event.

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external nonpayable
returns(bool)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| spender | address |  | 
| amount | uint256 |  | 

### transferFrom

Moves `amount` tokens from `sender` to `recipient` using the
allowance mechanism. `amount` is then deducted from the caller's
allowance.
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.

```solidity
function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external nonpayable
returns(bool)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| sender | address |  | 
| recipient | address |  | 
| amount | uint256 |  |
