This contract is a clone of the TESTAssetHolder contract. It is used for testing purposes only, to enable testing of transferAll and claimAll in multiple AssetHolders. It has a dummy storage variable in order to change the ABI. TODO remove the need for this contract by allowing TESTAssetHolder to be deployed twice.
